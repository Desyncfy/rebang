## [Rebang.Online](https://rebang.online)

An enhanced, feature-rich fork of [unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck) that makes DuckDuckGo's bang redirects lightning fast while adding powerful new features and a modern interface.


## Modern, Intuitive Interface

**!ReBang** features a clean, modern UI that makes searching with bangs more enjoyable:

* **Visual indicators** - See which bangs are available for your current query

## Expanded Bang Collection

**!ReBang** goes beyond DuckDuckGo's bang collection:

* **AI-focused bangs** - Quickly access ChatGPT (`!chat`), Claude (`!claude`), Perplexity (`!perp`), and other AI assistants
* **Curated collection** - Our bang list is regularly audited to remove dead links that DuckDuckGo hasn't maintained
* **Community suggestions** - New bangs are added based on user requests and usage patterns
